        <h2>Directions:</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>Mix chicken with seasoning blend in a medium bowl until the chicken is thoroughly coated.</li>
            <li>Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a large frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is heated, add the seasoned chicken and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up larger pieces, for 5 minutes or chicken is cooked through.</li>
            <li>While chicken cooks, wash and dry lime, scallions, and jalapeno.</li>
            <li>Trim the roots of the scallion and then thinly slice, separating whites from greens.</li>
            <li>Cut the lime into quarters.</li>
            <li>Trim the stem of the jalapeno and remove the core. Cut the jalapeno in half and remove ribs and seeds, then thinly dice.</li>

            <li>Fold the tortilla over and press firmly to close each quesadilla.</li>
            <li>Working in batches of two, add folded quesadillas to pan and cook, flipping, until each side is golden-brown.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine sour cream with the juice of two lime-quarters and mix, adding salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve the tortillas with the lime crema using scallion greens to garnish.</li>
